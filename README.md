# sanity-copypaste-poc

A minimal proof of concept for copy & pasting array elements from on document to another.

# Caveats

For the moment we will limit copy & pasting to arrays of the same type.

# Next Steps

- [] Extend POC to use more complex modules including images, references and in general more realistic structures and handle them
- [] Add proper error handling
- [] Include loading states for user feedback
- [] Make the functionality portable
- [] Improve design
